# Maven Test Project

This project includes a demonstration application.

## Running the Demo (Linux)

The demo application can be run using the provided shell script located in the `demo/target` directory.

There are two ways to run the script:

1.  **Using bash:**
    ```bash
    bash demo/target/run.sh
    ```

2.  **Making the script executable:**
    First, give the script execute permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x demo/target/run.sh
    ```
    Then, run the script directly:
    ```bash
    ./demo/target/run.sh
